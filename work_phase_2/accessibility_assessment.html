                <p>Accessibility assessment is the process of evaluating a website or application to ensure that it is usable by people with disabilities. This includes evaluating the design, content, and functionality of the site to ensure that it meets accessibility standards and guidelines.</p>
                <p>There are several different methods for conducting an accessibility assessment, including manual testing, automated testing, and user testing. Manual testing involves reviewing the site for accessibility issues, while automated testing uses software tools to identify potential problems. User testing involves having people with disabilities use the site and provide feedback on their experience.</p>
                <p>Accessibility assessment is an important part of the web development process, as it helps to ensure that all users can access and use a website or application. By conducting an accessibility assessment, developers can identify and address potential issues before they become a problem for users.</p>

                <h3>1.1.1 - Alternative Text for Non-text Content</h3>
                <p>What it is ?<br>Text alternatives make non-text content accessible. They provide information in a format that can be used by various senses (sight, hearing, touch) 
                    and technologies (screen readers). This allows people with different disabilities to understand the content. Text alternatives also support future 
                    adaptations like sign language translation.<br>
                    Goal: Ensure that all non-text content has a text alternative that serves the same purpose. This includes images, videos, audio files, and other non-text elements.
                    The text alternative should convey the same information and function as the non-text content.<br>Example: For example, an image of a dog should have a text alternative that describes the dog, such as "A brown dog playing with a ball."<br> This allows users who cannot see the image to understand its content and purpose.</p>
                </p>
                <h3>1.3.2 - Meaningful Sequence</h3>
                <p>What it is ? <br>This Success Criterion focuses on ensuring a logical reading order of web content can be programmatically determined. 
                    This order must preserve the meaning, especially when content is presented in alternative ways or with assistive technologies.<br>
                    Goal: To ensure content meaning isn't lost when presented in a non-visual or linear fashion.<br>
                    Example: For example, a list of items should be presented in a logical order, such as "1. Apples, 2. Bananas, 3. Cherries." <br> This allows users to understand the relationship between the items and their order.</p>
                </p>
                <h3>1.4.3 - Perceiveable text contrast</h3>
                <p>
                    What it is ? <br>The main focuses are on ensuring that text and images of text have sufficient contrast against their background. 
                    This is important for users with low vision or color blindness, as it helps them read and understand the content alongside accessing them.<br>
                    Goal: To ensure that text is easily readable and understandable for all users, regardless of their visual abilities.<br>
                    Example: For example, black text on a white background has a high contrast ratio, making it easy to read. However, light gray text on a white background has low contrast and may be difficult for some users to read.</p>
                </p>
                <h3>1.4.4 - Resize Text without Loss</h3>
                <p>What it is ? <br>
                    It addresses the scalability of visually presented text on web pages. It ensures that users with mild vision impairments can increase text size without relying solely on screen magnifiers. This includes regular text and text-based controls. 
                    The primary responsibility for text scaling lies with the user's web browser or user agent. However, content authors must design their websites to accommodate this scaling effectively. This means avoiding designs that break or obscure content when text is enlarged.<br>
                    Goal:  To enable users with mild visual disabilities to read text directly without needing screen magnifiers, by ensuring text can be enlarged significantly while remaining usable.<br>
                    Example: For example, if a user increases the text size in their browser settings, the text on the website should resize proportionally without causing layout issues or making content inaccessible. This ensures that users can read the content comfortably without losing functionality.</p>
                </p>
                <h3>2.1.1 - Keyboard Navigatbility</h3>
                <p>What it is ?<br>
                    This Success Criterion (operability through keyboard) mandates that all website functionality must be operable using a keyboard interface. This includes navigation through all interactive elements like links, buttons, and form fields. 
                    It is essential for users who cannot use a mouse or other pointing devices due to various disabilities. This requirement also extends to those who rely on assistive technologies that emulate keyboard input. Ultimately, it ensures that all users, 
                    regardless of their input method, can access and interact with all parts of the web content.<br>
                    Goal: To make all interactive elements accessible to users who cannot use a pointing device, ensuring they can navigate and operate the entire website using keyboard input alone.<br>
                    Example: Activating a focused element (e.g., clicking a button) can be done with the Enter or Space key.
                </p>
                <h3>2.4.7 - Focus Visibility</h3>
                <p>What it is?<br>
                Addresses the visual indication of keyboard focus on web pages. Its core aim is to ensure that users navigating with a keyboard can always determine which element is currently active. While web browsers often provide default focus indicators, this criterion places responsibility 
                on content authors to guarantee at least one clear and persistent visual focus indicator is present. This is particularly important for users who rely solely on keyboard navigation or have cognitive disabilities that make it difficult to track focus. The focus indicator should 
                remain visible as long as the element is focused.<br>
                Goal: To provide a consistent and clear visual cue indicating the active element for keyboard interaction.<br>
                Example: A text field shows a blinking cursor or highlights all text upon receiving focus.
                </p>
                <h3>3.1.1 - Reading Level</h3>
                <p>What it is ?<br>
                    Aims to ensure the primary language of a webpage is programmatically identified. This allows assistive technologies and browsers to correctly render text, including pronunciation for screen readers, proper character display, and accurate captioning for media.<br>
                    Goal: To enable correct processing and presentation of webpage text and linguistic content by user agents and assistive technologies, improving accessibility for users with various disabilities.<br>
                    Examples: An HTML page primarily in German uses <html lang="de">
                </p>
                <h3>3.2.3 - Consistent Navigation</h3>
                <p>What it is?<br>
                    mphasizes the importance of predictable placement for recurring content on a website. Maintaining the same order for elements like navigation menus and search bars across multiple pages significantly aids users. This consistency is particularly beneficial for individuals with 
                    low vision who rely on screen magnification and spatial memory. It also improves navigation for users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from predictable layouts. By ensuring repeated components appear in the same sequence, websites become easier and more efficient to navigate 
                    for a wider range of users.<br>
                    Goal:To improve website usability and navigation for users with visual and cognitive impairments by ensuring repeated elements appear in the same relative order on every page. <br>
                    Example: A site's main navigation links are always presented in the same order at the top of each page.<br>
                    A search bar is consistently located as the last element in the header across all pages.
                </p>
                <h3>3.3.2 - Labels or Instructions</h3>
                <p>What it is?<br>
                    Mandates that form controls must have clear labels or instructions to inform users about the expected input. For options like radio buttons and checkboxes, each choice needs a label. Instructions can also specify required data formats. While aiming for clarity, it cautions against excessive information. This criterion focuses on the presence of labels and instructions, not their markup or accessible naming, which are covered separately. It applies specifically to data entry form controls, not general interactive elements.

                Goal: To help all users, particularly those with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities, understand how to correctly complete forms by providing necessary labels and instructions for each control.<br>

                Examples:<br>

                A state abbreviation field has a link to a list of abbreviations.<br>
                A date entry field includes the expected format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY).
                </p>
                <h3>3.3.3 - Error Suggestions</h3>
                <p>What it is? <br>
                    This Success Criterion (error suggestion) requires websites to provide helpful suggestions for correcting user input errors. An input error is defined as information the user provides that the system doesn't accept, 
                    such as missing required data or incorrect formats. While 3.3.1 mandates error notification, this criterion focuses on guiding users toward the correct input.<br>

                    Goal: To assist users, especially those with cognitive or visual disabilities, in understanding and rectifying input errors by offering clear and actionable correction suggestions.<br>

                    Examples:<br>
                    After a failed form submission, the error message for a state field might link to a list of valid state abbreviations.<br>
                    If a user enters "12" in a month field, the system might suggest "December" or list all valid month names.
