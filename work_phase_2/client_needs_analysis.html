                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>
                    We are a non-profit organisation dedicated to fostering
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 1">
                        social cohesion
                    </span>
                    by empowering diverse communities to share their stories,
                    connect with others, and access resources that enhance their
                    visibility and influence. Our mission is to strengthen
                    societal bonds by creating platforms that celebrate and
                    support the unique identities of communities across
                    Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This brief has been prepared for the internal design teams
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 1">
                        at Connect Communities Initiative (CCI).
                    </span>
                    Each design team is tasked with developing individual
                    concepts and prototypes for dynamic websites that align with
                    CCIâ€™s mission and vision.
                </p>

                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    We are commissioning the development of dynamic,
                    user-friendly websites that represent and support different
                    communities. Each website should serve as a central hub
                    where community members can share resources,
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 1">
                        highlight events,</span
                    >
                    and
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 2"
                        >foster meaningful connections.</span
                    >
                    The websites must not include any form of commercial
                    activity, such as advertising or selling products. However,
                    it is acceptable to promote resources,<span
                        class="interactive-highlight"
                        data-card="Value 1"
                        >events,</span
                    >
                    or services that are directly beneficial to the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The websites must be accessible, mobile-friendly, and
                    reflect the diverse needs of the selected community focus
                    area while adhering to our mission of inclusivity,
                    accessibility, and ethical design. Each website should also
                    celebrate the unique characteristics of its chosen community
                    and support meaningful interaction and engagement.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p>
                <p>Each website must serve two key groups:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Community Members: Individuals within the selected
                        community who seek representation, resources, and

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        General Audience: Broader society, who can use the

                        contributions.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Accessibility must be prioritised to ensure seamless
                    interaction for all users, including those relying on
                    assistive technologies.
                </p>

                        community, recognising and representing the diversity
                        within the community rather than relying on stereotypes.

                    <li>
