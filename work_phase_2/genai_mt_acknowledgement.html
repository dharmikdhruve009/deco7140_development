                <h3>Reflections on Generative AI Use</h3>
                <h4>Incorporating GenAI into Web Design and Development</h4>
                <p>In DECO7140, I used Generative AI (GenAI), like ChatGPT and GeminiAI at most of my times, to enhance my web design process, 
                    balancing creativity, technical tasks, and ethics. For creativity, GenAI I asked for analogies from real life that simplified concepts like external CSS and JavaScript,
                    showing better file organization. Technically, it explained  JavaScript, helping me build a temperature widget with the <code>fetch()</code> method—though I verified its suggestions using W3Schools. I documented some of GenAI’s role 
                    and avoided directly using its outputs as mine. W3Schools website played an all round role in enhancing coding and learning which I preferred more over AI use.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Creativity</strong>: Use GenAI for initial ideas (e.g., layouts or features), adjusting to project needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Aid</strong>: Consult GenAI for syntax or troubleshooting or correcting any minor error unseen from naked eyes</li>
                    <li><strong>Ethics</strong>: Acknowledge GenAI use and assess its outputs in way of learning.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>GenAI was a valuable tool, but I prioritized my learning and understanding. I avoided reliance by cross-checking information with Wc3Schools webiste and using it as a guide. 
                    This approach ensured I developed understanding first and then benefiting from GenAI’s capabilities.</p>
                <h4>Critical Engagement with GenAI and MT Tools in Design Process</h4>
                <p>In DECO7140, I critically applied GenAI to my design process. While user research wasn’t emphasized early on, GenAI could suggest personas or questions—requiring real user data to validate. It clarified Progressive Web Apps and JavaScript Promises, 
                    but shallow responses needed cross-checking with MDN Web Docs and tutors. I avoided dependency by coding and aksing tutord about the temperature widget independently after using GenAI for guidance. For future projects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ideas</strong>: Start with GenAI concepts, refining via feedback.</li>
                    <li><strong>Research</strong>: Test GenAI for research tools, using outputs in real data from public access websites .</li>
                    <li><strong>Problem-Solving</strong>: Use GenAI to break tasks into steps and continue learning using real life analogies</li>
                </ul>
                <p>GenAI helped improve productivity and understanding, yet critical evaluation and independent work ensured authentic learning and ethical practice.</p>
