                GenAI is a project that aims to create a machine translation
                system that can translate text from one language to another with
                high accuracy and speed. The project is being developed by a
                team of researchers and engineers at GenAI Inc., a leading
                artificial intelligence company. The project is funded by the
                National Science Foundation and has received support from the
