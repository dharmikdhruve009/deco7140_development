                    <p class="initial-prompt">
                        Meet Priya, a bright and eager student who has recently
                        arrived in Australia from India. While the vibrant
                        energy of Brisbane is exciting, Priya is also navigating
                        the initial feelings of being far from home. Her
                        immediate focus is on building connections within the
                        local community, particularly with others who share her
                        Indian heritage or her passion for Bollywood movies,
                        dancing, and badminton. Finding a sense of belonging and
                        a supportive network is key as she embarks on her
                        academic journey in a new country.

                    <p class="question">
                        Question 1: "Priya, as you're settling into
                        Indooroopilly, what are the most important things you're
                        hoping to find in terms of connecting with others and
                        feeling more at home in this new place?"

                            Oh, definitely finding people I can connect with on a deeper level. 
                            It's exciting to be in a new country, but I really miss having those comfortable connections with people who understand my background. 
                            It would be a huge comfort to know there are local Indian cultural groups or even just a broader South Asian community where I could 
                            meet people who share similar experiences and maybe even speak my language. 
                            Just knowing those groups exist nearby would make me feel less isolated and more like I can build a little piece of home here.

                            <li>
                                I would love to find a local Indian grocery store or restaurant where I can get familiar food and maybe meet other people from my culture.

                            <li>
                                A local temple or cultural center would be a great place to meet people get rid of homesickness.

                        Question 2: "Thinking about your interests and
                        activities you enjoyed back home, like Bollywood movies,
                        dancing, or playing badminton, what kind of information
                        or features would be most helpful for you to find and
                        engage with similar opportunities or groups here in

                        <p>
                            For my interests, it would be fantastic to easily find groups or events related to them. For Bollywood, maybe a way to know if there are local screenings 
                            or even informal gatherings to watch movies. For dancing, I'd love to find dance classes or groups that focus on Bollywood styles, 
                            and it would be great to know the level – are they for beginners or more experienced dancers? And for badminton, just knowing if there are casual 
                            games happening or clubs I could join in the Indooroopilly area. Most importantly, when I find these groups, I really need to know if they are welcoming to new people, 
                            especially someone who's just arrived and might be a bit nervous. Clear information about what the group is like and how to get involved would be so helpful.

                            that gives me a starting point. Knowing the suburb or even a nearby landmark would make it much less daunting to consider going. 
                            Information about whether the location is easily accessible by public transport would also be really important as I'm still figuring

                        Introduce yourself to Phil, a thoughtful and observant student who has made the long journey from Colombia, 
                        South America, to study in Brisbane. While he's looking forward to his academic pursuits, Phil is also keenly aware 
                        of the significant cultural and economic differences between his home and his new environment. He's eager to connect 
                        with others and build a community while navigating the practicalities of life in Australia, from managing the higher 
                        cost of living to understanding the more reserved social norms and the nuances of Australian English

                            The biggest adjustments are definitely the cost of living and the cultural differences. Back home, things 
                            were much more affordable, so I'm really struggling to manage my budget here. Information on affordable housing, 
                            grocery shopping on a budget, and maybe even resources for student discounts would be incredibly helpful. 
                            Culturally, the people here seem a bit more reserved than what I'm used to. I'd appreciate any guidance on Australian 
                            social customs and ways to build connections, especially since I'm used to a very warm and expressive culture. I want to make sure I'm respectful while still being myself

                            "My biggest worry is Matei feeling isolated. Back in Romania, he had his established group of friends. 
                            Here, he's starting from scratch. I really need to understand where teenagers in Indooroopilly socialize. 
                            Specifically, what are the most popular social media apps and online platforms they use? Knowing if it's TikTok, BeReal, 
                            or something else entirely will help me guide him. Also, are there specific online communities or forums popular with 
                            teens in this area based on their hobbies, like gaming or music? Understanding this digital landscape is key for him to 
                            connect in a way that's natural for his age.

                        Question 2: "You're also hoping your wife, Elena, can build her own social network. What types of

                            Elena is very family-oriented, so I think she'd appreciate information on family-focused community 
                            groups in the area. Perhaps meetup groups for parents with children of similar ages to Andrei, our youngest. 
                            She also enjoys her hobbies, so knowing about groups centered around things like gardening or crafts would be great. 
                            Given we're new to Australia, cultural exchange opportunities where she can meet people from diverse backgrounds and
                            learn about the local culture while perhaps sharing our own Romanian traditions would be fantastic for her to connect 
                            and feel more integrated

                        Brisbane for children with autism spectrum disorder would be most crucial for you at this stage?"

                            For Andrei, I need comprehensive details about the support services available within the Queensland 
                            education system right here in Indooroopilly. What are the options for specialized educational programs 
                            or schools that have experience and resources for children with autism? I also need to understand the 
                            process for getting Andrei assessed and what steps are involved in accessing necessary therapies and educational support. 
                            Knowing about the availability of teacher aides, specialized curriculum adaptations, and the general approach to inclusive 
                            education for children with special needs in local schools is absolutely vital for us to make the right decisions for his well-being and development.
