                        I used AI like <strong>ChatGPT and GeminiAI to support the completion for DECO Work Phase 3. 
                        These tools assisted with explaining, code troubleshooting, drafting explanations, and reviewing content for clarity and accessibility.

                            Understanding Figma
                            Getting Started with the Basics
                            I asked GenAI to explain what Figma is and how it is used in web design. The responses clarified that Figma is a collaborative, browser-based design tool for creating wireframes, UI mockups, and interactive prototypes. 
                            GenAI also provided help to me to understand Figma‚Äôs unique advantages for teamwork and real-time editing.

                            Guided Tutorials and Feature Explanations
                            I requested step-by-step guides for: Creating a new project and setting up icons and links, cards and even buttons.<br/>
                            Using basic tools (shapes, text, images) and generating frames.<br/><br/>
                            GenAI summarized key Figma features such as  like exporting outputs for storing and later on using them<br/>
                            
                            Understanding Miro<br/>
                            I asked GenAI to explain what Miro is and how it works?


                            Reflection
                            GenAI was essential in:

                            Breaking down complex concepts into clear, actionable steps.

                            Providing instant, context-aware answers and troubleshooting.

                            Suggesting curated video tutorials and documentation for deeper learning.

                            
                            By using GenAI as a tutor, reference, and learning assistant, I was able to use Figma and Miro-tools that were previously completely unknown to me-and apply them effectively in my DECO project work.

                    <p>
                        Throughout Work Phase 3, GenAI tools were used as a support resource for brainstorming, technical troubleshooting, and refining written content. 
                        I checked all AI-generated suggestions, cross-checked information with W3Schools, and revised outputs.
