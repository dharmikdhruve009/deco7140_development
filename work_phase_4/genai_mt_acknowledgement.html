        <h1>GenAI MT Acknowledgement</h1>
        <p>In this section, we acknowledge the use of Generative AI tools in our project.</p><br>
    <li>AI history and acknowledgement</li><br>
        <ul>22/05: Use of Gemini was done to create vertical stacks of nav cards for visualizing information, allowing for more efficient data retrieval and organization.
            <ul>Make vertical stacks of nav cards instead of horizontal for all the pages I wish to implement</ul>
        </ul><br>
        <ul>27/05: Use of Gemini was done to create a image header for the user dashboard, enhancing the overall user experience.
            <ul>Created a visually appealing image header that aligns with the wireframe design</ul>
        </ul><br>
        <ul>27/05: Use of Gemini for adding background image to the nav-cards and Unsplash for image download
            <ul>Explored Unsplash API for high-quality images to enhance visual appeal</ul>
        </ul><br>
        <ul>28/05: Use of Gemini for creating a visually appealing info card header for the events page, enhancing the overall user experience.
            <ul>Created a visually appealing info card header that substituted accordions from the wireframe design</ul>
            <ul>What would be a better alternative layout for the events information?</ul>
        </ul><br>
        <ul>28/05: Use of W3Schools for blockquote
            <ul>Explored W3Schools for blockquote implementation to enhance the visual presentation of quotes said by someone</ul>
        </ul><br>
    </li>
    <li>AI was used for knowing for detail cards, including their content structure, visual design, and user interaction patterns.<br>These insights can be used for much better alternatives in case of the planned structure doesnt work, just like I used nested detail cards for accordion.</li><br>
    <li>Not everytime a minimal design is apprpriate, it is also good to have some visual elements to enhance user engagement where AI can play a crucial role.<br>In this website the events page features cards that have image in the background that tells more about what the element contains in it instead of just plain reading description</li>
