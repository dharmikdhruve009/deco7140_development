        <h1>GenAI MT Recognition</h1>
        
    <li>AI history and acknowledgement</li><br>
        <ul>22/05: Use of Gemini was done to create vertical stacks of nav cards for visualizing information, allowing for more efficient data retrieval and organization.
            <p>Make vertical stacks of nav cards instead of horizontal for all the pages I wish to implement</p>
        </ul><br>
        <ul>27/05: Use of Gemini was done to create a image header for the user dashboard, enhancing the overall user experience.
            <p>Created a visually appealing image header that aligns with the wireframe design</p>
        </ul><br>
        <ul>27/05: Use of Gemini for adding background image to the nav-cards and Unsplash for image download
            <p>Explored Unsplash API for high-quality images to enhance visual appeal</p>
        </ul><br>
        <ul>28/05: Use of Gemini for creating a visually appealing info card header for the events page, enhancing the overall user experience.
            <p>Created a visually appealing info card header that substituted accordions from the wireframe design</p>
            <p>What would be a better alternative layout for the events information?</p>
        </ul><br>
        <ul>28/05: Use of W3Schools for blockquote
            <p>Explored W3Schools for blockquote implementation to enhance the visual presentation of quotes said by someone</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>29/05: Use of Gemini for creating a visually appealing layout for the group activities page, enhancing the overall user experience.
                <p>Created a visually appealing layout that aligns with the wireframe design</p>
            </li>
        </ul><br>
    </li>
    <li>AI was used for knowing for detail cards, including their content structure, visual design, and user interaction patterns.<br>These insights can be used for much better alternatives in case of the planned structure doesnt work, just like I used nested detail cards for accordion.</li><br>
    <li>Not everytime a minimal design is apprpriate, it is also good to have some visual elements to enhance user engagement where AI can play a crucial role.<br>In this website the events page features cards that have image in the background that tells more about what the element contains in it instead of just plain reading description.</li><br>
    <li>Use of AI can be done in improving the card design for different  things.<br>In this case, using "story-card" and "span meta" for containing extra context or metadata about the person‚Äîsuch as their country of origin, destination, and their role.<br>The .story-meta class is styled (often with a different color, italics, or smaller font) to visually separate this information from the main name and story, making the card more readable and informative.</li><br>
    <li>Collaborative Use: I treated GenAI as a collaborative assistant‚Äîusing it to generate alternatives, review code, and suggest improvements, while retaining full responsibility for final decisions and compliance.</li><br>
    <li>Accessibility and Inclusivity: GenAI provided immediate suggestions for improving color contrast, structure, adding content inside the headers, adding tab able features and ultimately ensuring compliance with WCAG 2.1/2.2 and fostering an inclusive experience for users of all backgrounds and abilities</li>
    <li>Home Page: The horizontal cards with scroll functionality were enhanced using GenAI, allowing for a more dynamic and engaging user experience.</li><br>
    <li>Events Page: The design of the events page was improved with the help of GenAI where it suggested alternative layouts and visual elements like info cards with background images, making it more visually appealing and user-friendly.</li><br>
    <li>Group Activities Page: GenAI assisted in creating a visually appealing layout for the group activities page using a grid-based design card and its components, enhancing the overall user experience and aligning with the wireframe design.<br>Info like events and stats were fetched using GenAI to keep the content up-to-date.</li><br>
    <li>Resources Page: The resources page was enhanced with the help of GenAI, providing a more organized and visually appealing detail card layout a bit different from the events page for users to access valuable information.<br>Bright images in big fonts and background colours were used to create a more engaging visual experience.</li><br>
    <li>Community Stories Page: GenAI played a crucial role in creating visually appealing story cards with images and metadata, enhancing the overall user experience and making the stories more engaging and informative.</li><br>
    <li>Other Pages: GenAI assisted in creating a simple and effective layout for the other pages, ensuring consistency and usability across the website.</li><br>
