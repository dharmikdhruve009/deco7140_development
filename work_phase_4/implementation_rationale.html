            <h2>Implementation Rationale</h2>
            <ul>
                
                <li>
                    1. Buttons have been implemented with the hovering effect
                    using the accent colour upon hovering to keep the interface
                    engaging and interactive. This approach not only enhances
                    the visual appeal but also provides users with clear minimal
                    design good for visualization and simplicity.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    2. The hovering over the cards was changed to the root
                    colour scheme for consistency and visualization
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    3. Submit buttons have been styled to match the accent color
                    scheme instead of primary, ensuring they stand out and are
                    easily identifiable.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    4. For Events page, initially an accordion layout was
                    considered to organize event information effectively, but it
                    was later changed to a grid layout with info-cards as some
                    errors kept on repeating making it hard to trace.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    5. In the About us, the "h3" tag had to be changed with a bit of darker shade as accessibility demanded a higher contrast ratio.
                </li>
                <br /><br />
                <a>
                    <img
                        src="images/home_page_accessibility.png"
                        alt="Assessment of Home Page Accessibility"
                    />
                </a><br />
                <p>If --secondary-color is a light color (like #00bfae) and --background-color is white (#fff), the contrast ratio between the link text and its background will be 2.32:1‚Äîwell below the WCAG AA minimum of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large/bold text.<br>Thus,changes with respect nav links colour were made and changed a dark blue shade to resolve the issue given by IBM accessibility checker</p><br>
                <a>
                    <img
                        src="images/about_us_assessibility.png"

                    />
                </a><br />
                <p>In the image above the contrast ratio was changed to be well above the minimum 3:1 for large/bold text and 4.5:1 for normal text.<br> This button will be now readable for users with low vision or color blindness as the submit.btn background color was adjusted.</p><br/><br />

                </a><br />
                <p>In the above image the colours for "detailed-header" and "detailed-header-nested were changed to solve the contrast issue"</p><br/><br />

                    />
                </a><br />
                <p>The Image above shows 0 errors found in the Resources Implementation Rationale upon using IBM assessibility assessment checker</p><br />
                <a>

                    />
                </a><br />
                <p>Here, the replacement of the success story meta component color with a much darker teal was done to fulfil the better contrast requirement and resolve the issue.</p><br/><br />
