            <ul>
                <li>1. Buttons have been implemented with the hovering effect using the accent colour upon hovering to keep the interface engaging and interactive. 
                This approach not only enhances the visual appeal but also provides users with clear minimal design good for visualization and simplicity.</li><br>
                <li>2. The hovering over the cards was changed to the root colour scheme for consistency and visualization</li><br>
                <li>3. Submit buttons have been styled to match the accent color scheme instead of primary, ensuring they stand out and are easily identifiable.</li><br>

            </ul>
